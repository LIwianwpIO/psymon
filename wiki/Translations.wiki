===Contribute===

After you finished the translation of the strings, <br>make a new release with this format:
{{{
psymon_tr_XX.qm
}}}
Where  _XX_  put your language [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes ISO639-1] code.

Then send the generated .qm file at "kotsifi at gmail.com" with subject "Psymon-Translation-_XX_"
